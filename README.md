# Design Patterns

This repository contains exercises and practices from a university course on software design patterns. It includes examples of the following patterns:

- **Factory**: Creating objects without specifying the exact class.
- **Strategy**: Encapsulating algorithms to make them interchangeable.
- **Adapter**: Integrating classes with incompatible interfaces.
- **Composite**: Treating individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
- **Decorator**: Dynamically adding responsibilities to objects.
- **State**: Altering an object's behavior when its internal state changes.
- **Observer**: Defining a one-to-many dependency between objects.
- **Singleton**: Ensuring a class has only one instance.
- **Facade**: Providing a simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.

### Technologies

- **Language**: Java
