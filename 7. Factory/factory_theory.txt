# Factory method

This patterns allows us to couple in just one method the objects creation that has a common interface.



It's suggests that you replace direct object construction calls ('new' operator) with calls to a special factory method. These objects are still being created with the 'new' operator, but its called from within the factory method

### Elements:

  - 1. Factory Method: Method from some class that have the responsability to instantiate a class. 
  - 2. Product Interface: Common interface to the classes that needs to be instantiated the easy way
  - 3. Concrete Products: Concrete classes that implement the product interface
